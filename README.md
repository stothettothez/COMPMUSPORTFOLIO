# COMPMUSPORTFOLIO
My portfolio for computational musicology
In a year that has been nothing but bizarre for each and every one of us, something of a new habit originated: working from home. Of course, when something is a habit, Spotify turns it into playlists. Recently i stumbled on the folder *Thuiswerken* (Dutch for working from home) which consists of 12 playlists:

* Werkdag FM
* Focus Modus
* To Do List
* Calm & Focused
* Maximum Concentration
* Lo-Fi Beats
* Lofi Hip-Hop
* Lush Lofi
* Instrumental Study
* Jazz Vibes
* Coffee Table Jazz
* Deep Focus

I instantly started wondering what it is that makes these playlists suitable for working from home. Do they help you staying focussed or do they mimic workplace-like surroundings? And which are the musical elements that makes the listener feel this way?
These playlists differ tremendously in genre, tempo and amount of songs. Also the intention of the playlists, mentioned in the description of the playlist are very different from each other. Key phrases are rest, relaxation, focus and productivity. These would be the main goals to reach while working from home. I hope this portfolio will result in a better understanding of the musical elements associated with those states of mind. 
The playlist *Calm & Focused* is one that consists completely of classical music. It makes good sense that a playlist like this can be found in this folder, since there are a lot of people that believe their concentration is boosted by classical music. But what does the *To Do List* playlist mean in this context? As mentioned in the description the playlist it will boost productivity and consists of electronic music. Not so many people i know actively listen to electronic music to get focussed. So what makes this playlist ideal foor *Thuiswerken*? 
My portfolio will be all about answering these kinds of questions for the playlists.
